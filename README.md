Responsive design: The website is designed to work on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Book catalog: The website displays a catalog of books, including book covers, titles, authors, and prices.
Shopping cart: Users can add books to their shopping cart and view the total price of the items in their cart.
Local storage: The shopping cart is saved using local storage, so users can return to the website later and still see the items they added to their cart.
